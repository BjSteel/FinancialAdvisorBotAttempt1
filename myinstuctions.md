# Project Setup and Configuration Guide

## Package Management
I ran 'npm outdated' command to get outdated packages so i can update them.
but didnt update for now since they are breaking changes so it'll break your code and you have to start modifying especially tailwind.

## Project Restructuring
Then I moved everything inside your project folder to the root FinancialAdvisorbot folder.
Then I created an src folder and moved your main code inside and deleted the project folder.
Step 2 and 3 are standard practices.
Then I moved all your codes into the src folder(components, hooks, lib, app).
Your code layout is good for now but as your app gets bigger you will need to switch to a clean architecture.

## TypeScript Configuration
I found the issue.
You are using typescript so it needed extra config.
Let's see your current tsconfig.ts file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

## Project Structure Explanation
I didn't bother checking why your code didn't work initially since it wasn't following standard practice that was why I created an src folder and moved your code in. That's standard node project structure all codes should be in src that way everything is separated. So your code in src and all your config files like git ignore and others package.json postcss.config.js will be in the root folder of this particular project.

## Path Configuration Fix
So since the structure has been changed the same issues still happens but that's cause you are using typescript and this particular line of your ts config:
```json
"paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
```
`"@/*": ["./*"]` needs to point to the actual code directory which in the current case is src folder
so it'll now be:
```json
"@/*": ["./src/*"]
```

## TypeScript Server Restart
I ran the code after making that change and it worked but sometimes you might need to open any of your tsx file or ts file and run control shift p and when the text field pops up search for typescript restart server then let the server restart that should fix it.

## Tailwind Configuration
So your code is working now but it's not displaying css meaning tailwind isn't generating css so there is an issue somewhere let's work on that.
The issue was this in your tailwind.config.ts file:

```javascript
content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  ],
```

Since the code structure changed it needs to be:
```javascript
content: [
    './src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  ],
```

## Conclusion
So your code works now ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š nice project by the way, very good for a start then you can later move to fetching data from api instead of hardcoding it.
Updating to the latest version of next and react will require some changes to your code so you can leave for now.
